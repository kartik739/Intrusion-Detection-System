The objective is to detect network intrusions using a range of machine learning algorithms,
which will allow for continuous monitoring of a network or system to identify malicious activity
and protect it from unauthorized access by users, including potential insiders.
The task of an intrusion detector is to develop a predictive model, specifically a classifier,
capable of distinguishing between "bad connections" (i.e., attacks or intrusions) and "good connections" (i.e., normal activity).
